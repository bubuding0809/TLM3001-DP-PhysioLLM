      "The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic with complaints of lower back pain that has been bothering him for the past two weeks.

He notes that the pain worsens with prolonged sitting or standing and is relieved by lying down. He denies any recent trauma or injury but mentions that he has a history of occasional low back pain, especially after heavy lifting or prolonged periods of inactivity. He rates the pain as a 6 out of 10 on the pain scale. On physical examination, Mr. Smith appears uncomfortable but is able to walk into the examination room without assistance.\n",

      "Mr. Davis, a 60-year-old male, complains of chronic neck pain that he has experienced for the past six months. He describes the pain as constant, with a stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves slightly with movement throughout the day. He reports occasional headaches at the base of the skull and some tingling in the right arm. He has a history of cervical spondylosis diagnosed 5 years ago. The pain is rated at 4 out of 10 and does not radiate beyond his shoulder blades.\n",

      "On examination, Mr. Davis has a decreased cervical range of motion, particularly in rotation and lateral flexion to the right. Palpation reveals tenderness over the cervical paraspinal muscles and reduced mobility in the lower cervical spine. Spurling's test reproduces tingling in the right arm. Reflexes are normal, and there is no muscle weakness noted in the upper extremities. Sensory examination reveals decreased sensation in the right C6 dermatome. X-ray from a year ago shows degenerative changes in the lower cervical spine.\n",
