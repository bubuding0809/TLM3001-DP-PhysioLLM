Given the following subjective and objective assessment, provide a well informed and researched differential diagnosis

Subjective assessment:
The patient, is a 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic with complaints of lower back pain that has been bothering him for the past two weeks. He describes the pain as dull and achy, located in the lumbar region, with occasional radiation down his left leg. He notes that the pain worsens with prolonged sitting or standing and is relieved by lying down. He denies any recent trauma or injury but mentions that he has a history of occasional low back pain, especially after heavy lifting or prolonged periods of inactivity. He rates the pain as a 6 out of 10 on the pain scale.

Objective assessment:
On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but is able to walk into the examination room without assistance. Vital signs are within normal limits. Inspection of the lumbar spine reveals no obvious deformities or asymmetry. Palpation elicits tenderness over the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine, particularly on the left side. Range of motion of the lumbar spine is mildly restricted, with pain on forward flexion and left lateral bending. Straight leg raise test is positive on the left side at 45 degrees, reproducing his symptoms of radiating pain down the left leg. Neurological examination reveals intact sensation and strength in the lower extremities, with no signs of motor weakness or sensory deficits.
