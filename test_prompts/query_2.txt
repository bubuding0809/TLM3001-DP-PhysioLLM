Given the following subjective and objective assessment, provide a well informed and researched differential diagnosis

Subjective assessment:
The patient, a 30-year-old female, reports right shoulder pain that started gradually over the last three months. She describes the pain as sharp during overhead activities and dull when at rest. The pain is localized to the anterior shoulder and sometimes radiates down the arm. She notes difficulty lifting objects, especially above shoulder level, and states that the pain worsens after sleeping on her right side. She denies any specific injury or trauma but mentions increased activity in the gym recently. Pain is rated as 5 out of 10.

Objective assessment:
The patient has a slight forward shoulder posture and mild atrophy of the deltoid muscle on the right. Palpation reveals tenderness over the anterior aspect of the shoulder, particularly around the biceps tendon. Active range of motion (ROM) is limited in abduction and external rotation due to pain. Passive ROM is full but uncomfortable at end range. The Neer and Hawkins-Kennedy impingement tests are positive. The Speed's test elicits pain in the bicipital groove. Strength testing shows mild weakness in shoulder abduction and external rotation compared to the left side.
