Given the following subjective and objective assessment, provide a well informed and researched differential diagnosis

Subjective assessment:
The patient, a 60-year-old male, complains of chronic neck pain that he has experienced for the past six months. He describes the pain as constant, with a stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves slightly with movement throughout the day. He reports occasional headaches at the base of the skull and some tingling in the right arm. He has a history of cervical spondylosis diagnosed 5 years ago. The pain is rated at 4 out of 10 and does not radiate beyond his shoulder blades.

Objective assessment:
On examination, the patient has a decreased cervical range of motion, particularly in rotation and lateral flexion to the right. Palpation reveals tenderness over the cervical paraspinal muscles and reduced mobility in the lower cervical spine. Spurling's test reproduces tingling in the right arm. Reflexes are normal, and there is no muscle weakness noted in the upper extremities. Sensory examination reveals decreased sensation in the right C6 dermatome. X-ray from a year ago shows degenerative changes in the lower cervical spine.
